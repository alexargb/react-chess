# React Chess
### yeah
---
I like chess, so I decided to make my own *Chess*.
I made it with React as visual library, but all the logic behind it is just basic TypeScript written by myself, because I wanted to face the challenge.
I wanted to make it type safe so I did, it was a nice (and sometimes frustrating) experience, but finally got to achieve a functional version.
Give it a try at the [Github Pages](https://alexargb.github.io/react-chess/) published version.
